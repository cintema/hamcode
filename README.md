Hamcode

My tools/things for learning CW.

We use [ebook2cw][1] from Fabian Kurz to generate audio files that
contain a random collection of real words. Currently a german wordlist
(deutsch.txt) is used which we obtained from [netzmafia.de][2]. This
can be exchanged by any list which has its words seperated by a
newline.

The words can be limited to a certain set of characters. This is
helpful if you yet only know a limited amount of characters.

My plans are to extend this so this can generate real QSO like texts
so one can learn the typical patterns.
